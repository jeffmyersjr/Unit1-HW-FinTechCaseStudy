Going beyond 10 years, robo-advisors were first introduced in 2008 by Betterment.

## Results

**What has been the business impact of this company so far?**

Fidelity's Robo Advisor has led to more AUM and referrals since its inception. The creation of their robo-advisor is to continue to stay competitive in wealth management industry.

**What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?**

The core metrics in this domain are: AUM, overall client satisfaction, fees, minimums, and portfolio performance.  Compared to competing robo-advisors, Fidelity lags in AUM, higher-than -average portfolio management fees, higher-than-average portfolio performance, and superior planning software.

**How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?**

Fidelity's robo advisor typically is ranked in the top 3 of all it's competitors in various opinion on articles and consumer reviews albeit ranks low in AUM.

## Recommendations

**If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer?**

I would advise Fidelity to offer up flexible within their investment strategy - the option to limit certain asset classes, offer an ESG strategy, an incoming producing strategy, etc. If possible, having Fidelity change its cost structure to a subscription based model similar to Schwab or Merrill.

**Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?**

I think consumers would appreciate the customization and option to change their investment strategy. Research shows younger investors want an ESG strategy or socially conscience option with investing. I think Fidelity would be adapting to changing demographics. I believe changing the cost structure would also adapt to younger generations and their competitors who are targeting a generation where subscription pricing is a common theme across many industries and products.

**What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?**

Fortunately, I imagine the investment strategy would not need new technology other than adjusting their proprietary algorithm to include an ESG strategy. Changing the pricing strategy may require an update to the payment software, may need to acquire or utilize a SaaS program.
